    LSSH(1)                           General Commands Manual                          LSSH(1)

    NAME
           lssh - a wrapper for Lastpass CLI and ssh-agent

    SYNOPSIS
           lssh [ -hvpt ] [ssh key name]

    DESRIPTION
           lssh  quickly  activates  ssh keys by name, filling passwords via Lastpass CLI, and
           adding them to ssh-agent. Keys are activated for 1-hour at a time.

           The ssh key name provided to lssh will be used to look up both the key  itself  and
           the password for the key. If that key has a password, lssh will search Lastpass for
           an entry named `SSH: [ssh key name]' and autofill the password with the results. If
           that  entry  is not found, `[ssh key name]' will also be attempted before giving up
           on a password search. The key will be passed to the ssh-agent regardless.

    OPTIONS
           -h     Shows simple help.

           -v     Shows current version number.

           -p [pattern prefix]
                  Set LastPass prefix pattern for the title search.  The  default  pattern  is
                  `SSH:'. If your key is named `testkey', then the default pattern will search
                  `SSH: testkey' in LastPass for the key password.

                  This is the same as setting `pattern_prefix' in the configuration file.

           -t [type]
                  Set the SSH  key  type  to  test  for.  By  default  lssh  will  search  for
                  `id_ed25519', `id_dsa`, and `id_rsa` in that order.

                  This is the same as setting `key_types' in the configuration file.

    CONFIGURATION FILE
           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lssh/config
                  Configuration  settings  in  this  file will override default settings. Each
                  setting is a string that should be written as `NAME="VALUE"'. Valid settings
                  are `pattern_prefix', `lastpass_user', `key_locations', and `key_types'

    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
           Environment variables will override the default settings and any configuration file
           settings.

           SSH_KEY_LOCATIONS
                  List of folders containing ssh keys.

                  This environment variable can contain any number of folder paths, space sep‚Äê
                  arated,  which  will  be  used  to  search for the ssh keys. The folders are
                  searched in order and the search stops at the first successful match.

                  Unless otherwise defined, this variable defaults to ~/.ssh/

                  This is the same as setting `key_locations' in the configuration file.

           LASTPASS_USER
                  Login username to Lastpass. This is used to initiate a login if you are  not
                  already logged in when initiating lssh

                  This is the same as setting `lastpass_user' in the configuration file.

    EXAMPLES
           If you have an ssh key located at ~/.ssh/work/id_rsa, it can be loaded by entering:

           $ lssh work

    DEPENDENCIES
           lpass  The Lastpass CLI client

           expect programmed dialogue with interactive programs
